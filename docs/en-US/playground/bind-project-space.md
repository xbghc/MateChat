The steps for binding project space typically involve the following key components:

1. **Create Workspace**:

   - Log in to your cloud service platform (e.g., Huawei Cloud console).
   - Create a workspace and fill in the basic information of the workspace, such as name, description, etc.

2. **Select Computing Engine**:

   - During the workspace creation process, select the computing engine to be used.

3. **Configure Permissions**:

   - Set user or role access permissions for the new workspace according to requirements.

4. **Complete Creation**:

   - After confirming all settings are correct, submit to complete the workspace creation.

5. **Create Project**:

   - Create a project within the new workspace, usually through the "Data Development" module in the navigation menu.

6. **Associate Computing Resources**:

   - During the project creation phase, specify that the project is associated with the previously selected computing engine so that the project can use the provided storage and computing capabilities.

7. **Bind Project Space**:

   - In the source workspace, enter the project details page, click the "Bind Workspace" button, select the target workspace, then click the "Confirm" button and wait for the system to complete the project migration operation.

8. **Resource Binding**:

   - In project space management, you can perform binding allocation operations on resource pools already created in the current region to achieve resource isolation requirements for different project spaces.

9. **Edit Project Space**:
   - If you need to modify the project space configuration, you can hover over the dropdown in the upper right corner of the project space card, click "Edit", and modify the project name, description, member authorization, resource binding, etc.

The above steps provide a basic guide for binding project spaces on different cloud service platforms. Specific operations may vary depending on the platform.
