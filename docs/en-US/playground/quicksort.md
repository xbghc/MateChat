Of course. Quick Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach. Here's a JavaScript implementation of the quicksort algorithm:

```javascript
function quickSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length < 2) {
    return arr;
  }

  const pivot = arr[0];
  const left = [];
  const right = [];

  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] < pivot) {
      left.push(arr[i]);
    } else {
      right.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }

  return [...quickSort(left), pivot, ...quickSort(right)];
}

// Usage example
const arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1];
console.log(quickSort(arr)); // Output the sorted array
```

This quicksort implementation uses recursion. It first selects the first element of the array as the pivot, then divides the array into two parts: one containing all elements smaller than the pivot, and another containing all elements greater than or equal to the pivot. This process is recursively applied to the left and right parts until the array is split into individual elements, then the sorted subarrays are merged.

Please note that this implementation is not in-place sorting because it creates new arrays to store intermediate results during the sorting process. If you need an in-place sorting version, it can be achieved with slight modifications.
